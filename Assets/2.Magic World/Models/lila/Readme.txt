Assets where ripped from the PC verson of Atelier Ryza. Ripped was thanks to Ploaj's tool, however edited quite a bit by me (Kuro).

Standard edits include merging meshes together to make a whole (like two halves of a face) and other slight changes caused by messy exports.

I have notice that the UV's are a little wonky. You should not need to worry about those. Its a product of an issue however proves to do nothing visually. Its still a problem
that I need to fix, and I will fix it if I can, which is why its not seen eveywhere.

Finally, bone names have been added but they are sometimes incorrect. Whenever this happened it was always on a couple of bones, so I decided to leave the names in.


If there is anything you "Need" To know, it would be listed below:
